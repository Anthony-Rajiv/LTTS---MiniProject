Five of the ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits were found to contain errors.
Specifically, there were several different nodes mapped onto the same name
resulting in multiply defined nodes. The corrections have been made by adding
an extra "I" to some node names to differentiate the nodes. The corrections
are listed below. The files have already been updated.

Date: January 24, 1991

A total of seven ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits have been modified. Four of the
seven circuits have been modified to eliminate flip-flops that were unreachable
by any path starting at the primary inputs. This was accomplished by removing
selected flip-flops from the circuit and declaring these flip-flop inputs and
outputs to be primary outputs and inputs, respectively. The affected circuits
are s9234, s13207, s15850 and s38584. The other three circuits modified are
digital fraction multipliers that were functionally incorrect. The affected
circuits are s208, s420 and s838. All seven circuits have been renamed to
add a .1 suffix to their names. For example, the corrected version of
s208.bench is named s208.1.bench. The old versions of these circuits will
no longer be distributed as part of the ISCAS'89 benchmarks.

Questions should be emailed to bryan@mcnc.org or phone (919) 248-1432.
